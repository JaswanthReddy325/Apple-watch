App.js:

Imports:

React is imported for building the user interface components.
BrowserRouter and its components (Routes, Route) are imported from react-router-dom for handling user navigation between different pages (Home and Customize).
App component:

This component renders the main layout of the application.
It uses BrowserRouter to wrap the application's content, enabling routing functionalities.
Inside Routes, it defines two routes:
/: This route renders the Home component, which is the starting page.
/customize: This route renders the Customize component, likely where users can select case, size, and band for their watch.
Home.js:

Imports:

React is imported for building UI components.
useNavigate hook is imported from react-router-dom to handle navigation programmatically.
Home component:

This component represents the starting page of the application.
It has a header with the Apple logo and title.
The content section displays a heading and an image of the Apple Watch.
A button with "Get started" text is present.
The handleGetStartedClick function uses useNavigate to navigate the user to the /customize route when the button is clicked.
Data (watchData.js - Not provided):

This file likely contains the data about the watch models (Series 10, Series 10 Pro, etc.), including their sizes, case materials (Aluminum, Titanium), bands, and potentially images.


Customize.js


1. Imports and Data:

React, useState are imported.
watchData (which you provided) is crucial. It's a JavaScript object holding the watch models, their sizes, cases, bands (with images and prices), and associated images. This is the source of truth for the customization options.
2. State Variables (using useState):

selectedModel: Stores the currently selected watch model (e.g., "Series 10").
selectedSize: Stores the selected size (e.g., "42mm").
selectedCase: Stores the selected case material (e.g., "Aluminum").
selectedBand: Stores the selected band name (e.g., "Sport Loop").
currentSlide: Manages the current position in the image slider.
sliderImages: An array of image URLs to be displayed in the slider.
currentSelection: Keeps track of which category (Size, Case, or Band) is currently being selected.
3. currentModel Variable:

const currentModel = watchData.models[selectedModel]; This line dynamically retrieves the data for the currently selected watch model from the watchData object. This makes it easy to access the sizes, cases, bands, and base price for the chosen model.
4. Event Handlers:

handleButtonClick(type): This is the core logic for populating the image slider.
It takes the type ("Size", "Case", or "Band") as an argument.
It sets the currentSelection state.
It retrieves the appropriate data (sizes, cases, or bands) from currentModel.
It creates an array of image URLs (images) based on the selected type.
It updates the sliderImages state with this array and resets currentSlide to 0.
handleModelChange(event): Updates the selectedModel state when the user selects a different model from the dropdown. It also resets selectedSize, selectedCase, selectedBand, and the slider.
handleSlideChange(direction): Handles navigation within the image slider ("prev" or "next").
handleSizeSelection(size), handleCaseSelection(caseType), handleBandSelection(bandName): These handlers are called when the user selects a specific size, case, or band. They update the corresponding state variables and update the slider with the selected image and the other options for comparison.
5. renderSliderImages() Function:

This function is responsible for rendering the images in the slider.
It handles displaying a maximum of 5 images at a time, centering the currently selected image and scaling it up for emphasis.
It uses slice to get the correct portion of the sliderImages array for display.
The isCenter variable determines if an image should be highlighted (scaled up).
6. JSX (The returned structure):

A header displays the current model name.
A dropdown allows the user to select the watch model.
Buttons for "Size," "Case," and "Band" trigger the handleButtonClick function.
The slider section displays the images using renderSliderImages(). It also includes previous and next buttons for navigation.
Below the slider, there are buttons that display the options for the current selection (Size, Case, or Band).
Finally, the selected options (size, case, band) and the total price are displayed.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
